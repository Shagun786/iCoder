                <p class="lead">It all began with a single idea—iCoder. A simple thought turned into a powerful platform
                    that challenges the norms of traditional learning and development. The mission was clear: make
                    coding accessible, engaging, and fun for everyone. It was the beginning of a journey that would
                    change how people approach technology and innovation.The idea that started small now has a global
                    impact, and it's only just the beginning.</p>

                </h2>
                <p class="lead">In 1877, iCoder was born—not in the digital age we know today, but as a radical idea for
                    the future. Back then, the concept of coding and technology was still in its infancy, and our vision
                    was far ahead of its time. We dreamed of a platform where anyone could learn to code, innovate, and
                    shape the future of technology. Fast forward to today, and that initial spark has turned into a
                    movement, transforming how we understand and interact with the digital world. The journey from 1877
                    to now has been nothing short of mind-blowing!</p>

                <p class="lead">Long before tech became trendy, we were crafting logic with passion. iCoder wasn't just
                    built—it was born from late nights, coffee-fueled dreams, and fearless minds who dared to think
                    differently. That picture? It captures a moment in history where vision met execution.</p>
